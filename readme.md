# Python Sudoku

    Status: undergoing bottom-to-top rebuild.

Main game function `sudoku()` in `sudoku.py`.

Terminal implementation of classic sudoku game. Generates boards by method outlined in `generator.pdf`. Once implementation of that is complete and I review my stat mech, I'd like to take a crack at the method in `chaos_solver.pdf` and `ksat_solver_detail.pdf`. Will eventually build simple Flask front-end.
